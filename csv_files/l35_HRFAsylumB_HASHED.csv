I also choose explicit and descriptive variable names and function declarations. I also prefer writing explicit code instead of short and clever code that only I would understand at first glance, but perhaps one could argue for writing concise code.

I'm also very good at communicating through writing and I'm good at writing mechanically.

I understand the high-level conception of binary trees and graphs and their use cases, but I would not know how to implement them in a project.

I'm not a very good verbal communicator.

There's something very enjoyable about articulating your thoughts â€” it's almost as if you are untangling your mind as you write.

I believe it might be because sometimes we can understand something on one level of analysis but not understand it on another. This fact is often attributed to the reason why dreams are often ambiguous and absurd. Dreams are collections of unarticulated thoughts and the dream, in part, is the mind's attempt to express them.

I'm not necessarily a good writer, but I do enjoy the act of writing.","What I'd really like to improve is my ability to communicate through speech because I can be a very awkward speaker. 

For some reason, it's more difficult for me to find the ""right words"" when speaking verbally, but I can write about almost anything no problem. If the topic is technical and complex then it will certainly take a lot longer and more research, but I could do it given enough time.","I wrote a lot for my college classes because the coursework demanded it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.",The visuals,
