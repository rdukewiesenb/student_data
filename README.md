# Student Data Analysis

Beginning March 2021, I have been designing, iterating and adminstering diagnostic surveys at Lambda School. The diagnostic surveys are intended to identify student strengths and areas of improvement, as well as their goals for the Labs program. Through the survey responses, I have been able to gain a deeper understanding of each student and address their individual developmental needs. 

(For reference, Labs is where students get to apply the technical skills they've gained from Lambda's core and computer science curricula while developing products for non-profits. In the process, students also establish foundations for professional skills such as proposal drafting, presenting and time management.)

Now that I have collected all of this raw data, I want to collate and visualize it, so that the information is not only easily accessible but also easily digestible. 

My first step is to clean the data. To maintain transparency, I will upload each iteration of my data wrangling process, to show each stage of my script writing and editing.

To protect students' identities, all partiicpant names will be enhashed. Additionally, the `name` feature will be omitted from each uploaded CSV.

As I continue to collate the data, I will add to this README.
